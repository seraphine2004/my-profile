        <h2>Chicas in tecnologia</h2>
        <p>
     The combination of my interest in teamwork and my desire to make the world better led me to the «Chicas en tecnología» Argentinian project. My team and I participated in the «PUUM» program (Programando Un Mundo Mejor). </strong>The aim of the project was to raise awareness about the small number of women involved in technology.</strong> We had to identify an issue in our daily lives and create an app to fix it using MIT app inventor software.

        <h2>Humanitarian</h2>
        <p>
           I signed up for </strong>a humanitarian project led by the Iranian photographer Reza in the “Villa31”, the biggest slum of Buenos Aires, Argentina. </strong> Children from “villa 31” were trained in photography while my schoolmates and I helped them express the message they wanted to convey with their pictures. A book of the photographs was published to highlight social inequalities, and presented to the French Embassy in Buenos Aires. It was an inspiring and eye-opening experience.

        <h2>Tennis</h2>
        <p> 
          I play tennis since I am 5 years old, and I am now 18. This sport is an activity in which I like to improve by setting me goals to achieve. I like to play with my father, my brother and friends. </strong> It helps me to take time for me, be less anxious and feleling well to start the day</strong>.
